Student Project 

Project is hosted in a S3 Bucket. We use AWS API for Endpoint Management.

Goal of this project was to demonstrate the use of Alexa in CI/CD.
The Alexa Skill allows us to build new projects via Jenkins, rebuild Lambda functions and host Projects immediatly in Buckets.

We combined for this small (2 weeks) project different technologies. 

A blank "news page" gets filled with content after activating an alexa skill.
